      'My time in Argentina will never be forgotten, and that is all because of the Schmidt family. They took me into their home like one of their own. I spent a month living with strangers but by the end of the trip they felt like family. While I lived with them I took tennis lessons with Brian and he transformed me from a complete klutz to someone able to keep up in the game. The family made it so fun to play tennis, and although I was a complete beginner, they always encouraged me to keep going. I will never be able to thank them enough for the tennis lessons and for my time in Argentina.',

    description: `I am Carlos Pardo from Colombia. During my stay in Argentina, I lived in the Schmidt family's house. They made me feel welcome as if I were part of the family. I went to train as an Assistant Coach accompanied by Sebastian Schmidt. It was truly an enriching and fulfilling experience. The training was rigorous and adjusted to my level of play. I will support them from Colombia representing the Schmidt Tennis Academy because I want to spread that joyful and passionate way of living tennis.`,

    description: `What an excellent project, my dearest Schmidt family!!!! I say family because we have known each other for 30 years, and those years give me some relevance to say it! The truth is that it has been a huge stroke of luck for me to have crossed paths with Seba (I always tell him) first as a coach and then as a friend. I mentioned the years we have been together in this sport we love to emphasize the importance Seba has in all of this. It is very difficult, and Seba achieved it with the support of his family, to lead a group of students, coaches, colleagues, and friends for so long and make everything work. Sebas' ability to transmit his passion and enthusiasm to us, without forgetting that it is a job for him, with professionalism and absolute dedication, even in cold, hot, or rainy weather, has made all of this possible. Not only did he do this for us, he did something even greater, he passed all of his concepts of work, dedication, and love for this sport on to his children, who deserve a separate chapter of praise. I know that this ACADEMY project, which we just found out about, started a long time ago and has to do with Brian's first trip to study at a university in the USA, with all that implies, detaching from his loved ones, family, and friends, and carrying his feelings in his heart, followed by his brother Alan with the same steps. I have been a student of both of them and I assure you that they have a teaching technique (and patience) and respect worthy of mention. And lastly, the most important thing, the woman behind (and ahead of) this whole enterprise, who managed to unite Seba's friends with his family: Maria Ines, aka La Pipi, as we all know her. Without a doubt, what was born as I just mentioned, without improvisation and with all professionalism always at the forefront, is assured of success. Finally, I invite everyone who wants to start living tennis to do so through this path!!! Schmidt family and Academy, I wish you all the best, I love you, and I will always be with you.`,

    description: `I have known the Schmidt family for practically my entire life, and now they are like my family too. My journey with the academy in Argentina began with me as a student and it evolved to something that I never would have imagined. Everything I know about tennis has been greatly influenced by the academy, especially by Sebas who has been like a mentor to me all these years. The thing that makes this academy so special is not only the fact that you learn and progress tennistically, if not that you also get this sense of belonging with every single one of the members involved. Whenever I am in doubt, or needing company, you can always count on someone in the academy to be by your side. Through the years I have learned valuable lessons about tennis that I will never forget. Honestly speaking, I never thought that I would be playing at the level I am now if it weren't for Sebas.
      He managed to bring the best out of me and gave me the space necessary to achieve it, even when I thought it wasn't possible, and for that I will always be grateful.
      Apart from that, Alan (Sebastian's son) is my best friend, and it has been like that for many years now, and if it hadn't been for the academy, we would have never even met each other, which now feels crazy to me. Every member of the Schmidt family has always made me feel special and loved, and those are things that are essential when you are in a learning phase, because feeling comfortable and having good company are the foundation of every successful journey. Nowadays I train and also teach at the academy in Argentina, and having the possibility to be there doing what love every single day, is something that I wouldn't change for anything in the world.

    description: `Hello, my name is Owen. I am a student and friend of Sebas, Brian, and Alan. To say that they are incredible people is an understatement. They love their profession and are always there for us, from the toughest moments to the best moments of our tennis. Since I was very young, they made me feel at home and part of their family. They have a lot of experience in high-performance training and always know the right words to help us improve. The most important thing is that the Schmidts make you feel comfortable in their environment, making you part of their family and a person loved by them. That is why I am happy to be part of this academy and enjoy improving with them.`,

      'We really love Sebas, he is a great person and as a coach, what can we say, he is the best. He has a love for his profession and has a great track record in training many boys and girls in this exciting sport called tennis. He has the right words to give an instruction, whether it is technical to improve strokes or theoretical to plan a match. Camila adores him, she listens to him all the time, she is always attentive to what her coach tells her in order to keep progressing. He supports her in difficult moments. We are really happy that Camila is part of the Schmidt Tennis Academy and that Sebastian is her coach!',

    description: `My name is Mariano De Luca, I am 24 years old and I met the Schmidt family about 7 to 8 years ago. I arrived at Temperley Lawn Tennis Club and they welcomed me in the best way. Shortly after, I became very good friends with Brian Schmidt and Alan Schmidt, we trained together and competed in the same team. At the same time, I started teaching tennis classes at TLTC's academy, a hardworking person who knows a lot about this sport and helped me a lot with his knowledge. Over the years, they became like a family to me, we get together very often and go out to eat at least once a week with one of them. We even spent Christmas together with them and Pipi (Sebastian's wife and Brian and Alan's mother) who welcomed us into her home and made us feel very comfortable. They are a family that breathes tennis, good energy, and a lot of passion and dedication for what they do. I have no doubt that their new project will grow and they will achieve everything they set out to do.`,

    description: `Hi, my name is Maxi Zanazzi, friend and colleague of both Brian and Seba. I can only use praise when referring to them because, in Seba's case, he was one of my trainers both for competition and for the professional environment, teaching me my first steps and providing me with tools to develop myself in the teaching of our beloved sport. A passion that we were able to share over 15 years on the court. As for Brai, a great friend with whom we shared many hours of hard training, competitions, and work. We carried out classes with different groups of students, both with schoolchildren and advanced level groups, organizing representative teams and social events at the institutional level. In this new and great beginning of the Schmidt Academy, I only wish them a lot of success, knowing that they will always count on me and above all, that they can transmit the great values of the sport as they have done over so many years! Good luck, my friends.`,

    description: `My name is Rodrigo Gonzalez, I am 29 years old and it has been approximately 15 years since I met the Schmidt family. They are a warm family full of good values. They made me feel like a part of the family from the very first moment. Sebastian is a great professional with passion, love, enthusiasm, and dedication in his day-to-day life. He was there for every step I took in this sport, and today being a coach is partly thanks to his support and trust. As for Brai, he is a dedicated and persistent professional, an excellent person. We have shared training, competitions, and a great friendship both on and off the court over the years. And today we share the same passion, which is to teach this sport.
    Schmidt family, I wish you many successes, and may the love and passion for this great sport extend as far as you can dream it.`,

    description: `My name is Marcos De Luca, and I am Mariano De Luca's brother. Thanks to him and a club tournament, I was able to go to the Temperley Lawn Tennis Club one day. Since that day, which was just a simple tennis tournament, I saw something in the Schmidt family and the people at the club that I had not seen before. I found a very nice atmosphere, both among the students themselves and between students and coaches. But what I liked the most was the group of club coaches, always with a good predisposition to give their best in the academy day by day. After some time, I went frequently to the club to play and train with different players. But the day I met Alan Schmidt, we generated an incredible chemistry, both when training and when having fun. After a few months, I felt increasingly comfortable in the club, and they gave me the opportunity to start as a coach. It was not only time in the club, but the Schmidts are an incredible family, and they have invited me on weekend vacations, to spend Christmas holidays together, and to share meals very frequently. I am always grateful to Sebastian Schmidt, as he is an incredible person, a very good coach, and his energy to work and teach tennis every day is admirable. I want to wish the whole family the best for this new project and this new stage. I have no doubt that with the effort and dedication of everyone together, it will be a unique experience.
    I send you a big greeting from a distance, especially to Brian Schmidt, who is a great friend, and to Alan Schmidt, who is like a brother to me.
    Many successes. Mac`,
